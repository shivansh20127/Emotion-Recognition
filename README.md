# Emotion Recognition Using Classical ML Techniques

This project demonstrates that classical machine learning techniques can outperform deep learning in emotion recognition tasks, particularly in terms of interpretability and computational efficiency. Using the RAVDESS dataset, various classical ML methods were applied to achieve high accuracy in recognizing emotions from audio recordings.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
- **Techniques Used**: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Grid Search, Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
- **Highlights**: Emphasis on interpretability and computational efficiency

## Tech Stack
- SVM
- Grid Search
- Regression
- PCA
- MFCC
